# Coding project: Suggestion Box React Web App

## Objective
This coding project will assess a web developer's ability to create a React web application with specific
functionality. It allows candidates to demonstrate their proficiency in architecture, state management,
and data presentation.

## Overview
Create a React web application that simulates an online “suggestion box” for an organization:
- Community members can submit new suggestions.
- Each suggestion has an associated comment thread where community members and the
original submitter can discuss the idea.

## Requirements
1. In-memory data provider: Implement a data provider that stores the suggestions and
comments in memory. You can use any suitable data structure for this purpose.
2. Mock data: Load some hard-coded data into your data provider so the app has a few
suggestions and comments to display at startup.
3. UI: Create a screen or component to display the suggestions and comments.
4. Random suggestions: Add functionality that randomly generates new, simulated suggestions
and sends them to the app.
5. User suggestions: Implement a feature that allows users to create new suggestions and add
comments.

## Submission
Provide either a GitHub repository or email the code as a zip file. Include instructions on how to run the
application, any dependencies needed, and any additional notes you want to share with the reviewer.

## Evaluation Criteria
The candidate's solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
1. Functionality: Does the application meet the specified requirements?
2. Code quality: Is the code well-organized, readable, maintainable, and annotated? Does it follow
best practices for React development?
3. Architecture: Does the project demonstrate good architectural practices, is it designed to be
flexible, extensible, and updatable?
4. State management: Is the state managed effectively within the application?
